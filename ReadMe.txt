    CONSOLE APPLICATION : for-3D-printer Project Overview
========================================================================

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your for-3D-printer application.

The project is dedicated to the development of a computer program designed 
to automate typical tasks encountered in 3D printing laboratories in preparation 
for the production of products from electronic drawings provided by customers.\
Developed features:
	- Reading files in binary and text format STL.
	- Checking for geometric errors in the file.
	- Counting model volume.
	- Generation of a control program for a 3D printer.
	- Calculation of the duration of printing.

for-3D-printer.cpp
    This is the main application source file.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named for-3D-printer.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.
